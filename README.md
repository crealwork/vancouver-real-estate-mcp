# Vancouver Real Estate MCP

An MCP server that gives any AI agent 35 years of Metro Vancouver and Fraser
Valley benchmark prices — 1991-06 to 2026-06, 136 areas, 61,034 monthly points.

Everything here is built from public board publications. Aggregate statistics
only: no listings, no individual transactions.

## Layout

```
ingest/     data pipeline (Python)
data/raw/   downloaded sources, gitignored except the small ones
data/out/   parsed + merged output, including the SQLite the server ships
server/     Next.js MCP server, deployed to Vercel
```

## Sources

| Source | Coverage | Granularity |
|---|---|---|
| [CREA MLS® HPI archive](https://www.crea.ca/housing-market-stats/mls-home-price-index/hpi-tool/) | 2005-01 → current | board |
| [GVR monthly stats packages](https://www.gvrealtors.ca/) | 2018-12 → current | neighbourhood |
| [FVREB monthly stats packages](https://www.fvreb.bc.ca/statistics/) | 2008-01 → current | neighbourhood |
| [FVREB HPIMLX database](https://www.fvreb.bc.ca/statistics/HPIMLX_DB.xlsx) | 1991-06 → 2011-09 | neighbourhood, both boards |

## The one thing to understand

The boards have **restated** the MLS® HPI more than once. FVREB publishes the
proof itself — a workbook of "Revised Benchmark Price" against "Original
Benchmark Price". The effects are large:

- the legacy HPIMLX series sits up to ~35% away from the current CREA
  benchmark on their 2005-2011 overlap;
- within a single source, FVREB's own packages jump: Fraser Valley Board reads
  index 223.9 in the June 2010 package and 144.3 in June 2012.

So the sources cannot simply be concatenated. Instead:

1. every source is cut into segments wherever its own month-over-month move
   exceeds 20% (no real market moves that fast — Vancouver's worst months were
   around -5%), which catches restatement boundaries wherever they fall;
2. segments are sorted newest-first, so the most recent data defines the level;
3. each older segment is chain-linked on — by the overlap ratio where the
   segments overlap, by the adjacent-month ratio where they merely abut, and
   across long holes by carrying the wider market's growth over the hole.

Each point records how it was placed:

| basis | meaning | count |
|---|---|---|
| `as_published` | exactly what the board published | 43,222 |
| `chain_linked` | rescaled onto the current index level | 10,676 |
| `bridged` | level inferred across a hole in the record | 7,136 |

Activity data is merged onto 5,348 of those points.

The MCP tools surface this: `*` marks chain-linked, `+` marks estimated.

## Known gaps

- **GVR neighbourhood data, 2011-10 → 2018-11.** The board does not publish
  packages that far back and they are not in the Wayback Machine. Board-level
  Greater Vancouver is unaffected (CREA covers it continuously from 2005).
- **2025-01 and 2025-02 GVR HPI tables.** GVR withdrew them: "a technical error
  in the data feed used for the calculation of the Home Price Index". The
  corrected packages omit the tables, so we leave those months empty.
- **2022-06 GVR package** — no URL found under any known naming pattern.
- FVREB packages before 2015 carry no ten-year change column, since the index
  only began in 2005.

## Rebuilding

```bash
PY="$HOME/Desktop/Claude Code/.venv/bin/python"
cd ingest
$PY fvreb_hpi_db.py      # legacy 1991-2011 (needs data/raw/HPIMLX_DB.xlsx)
$PY crea_hpi.py          # finds and downloads the current CREA archive
$PY discover_gvr.py      # probes GVR PDF URLs -> data/out/gvr_pdf_index.json
$PY boards_pdf.py both   # downloads and parses both boards' packages
$PY boards_activity.py   # sales / listings / inventory from the same PDFs
$PY build.py             # merge + chain-link -> series.jsonl
$PY verify.py            # must print PASS
$PY to_sqlite.py         # -> data/out/vanre.db
cp ../data/out/vanre.db ../server/data/
```

`verify.py` checks the merged series against twelve figures the boards
published themselves, and fails on any month-over-month jump above 20%.

### Monthly refresh

`.github/workflows/monthly-update.yml` does this automatically on the 6th of
each month, after both boards have posted and CREA has regenerated its archive.
It only commits and deploys when `verify.py` passes, so a layout change or a
bad merge leaves production serving the last good build and opens an issue
instead. Board PDFs never change once published, so `data/raw` is cached
between runs and only the new month is fetched.

Trigger it by hand with `gh workflow run monthly-update.yml`.

One caveat on reproducing the database byte-for-byte: `pdftotext` output varies
slightly between poppler releases, so a local rebuild can differ from the
runner's by a handful of rows out of ~10,000. The runner is the source of
truth; `verify.py` is what guards quality, not byte equality.

## Server

```bash
cd server
pnpm install
REQUIRE_API_KEY=false pnpm dev     # MCP at http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

Environment:

| var | purpose |
|---|---|
| `API_KEY_SECRET` | required — HMAC secret for issuing/verifying keys |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | optional — emails the key to the requester |
| `MAIL_FROM` | optional — sender address |
| `NOTIFY_EMAIL` | optional — copy of each issuance |
| `PUBLIC_HOST` | optional — host shown in instructions |
| `REQUIRE_API_KEY` | set `false` to disable auth locally |

Keys are stateless: claims plus an HMAC, so verification needs no database.
The SQLite file is bundled with the deployment and read via Node's built-in
`node:sqlite`, so there is no native module to compile and no database to run.

## Tools

`data_coverage`, `list_areas`, `get_price`, `get_price_history`,
`compare_periods`, `compare_areas`, `rank_areas`, `market_activity`,
`market_extremes`.

## Market activity

Beyond prices, the packages carry sales, new listings and active inventory.
`boards_activity.py` extracts them, and `market_activity` exposes the
sales-to-active-listings ratio the boards themselves cite (under 12% sustained
means downward pressure, over 20% upward).

The two boards print this very differently. FVREB uses a vertical block per
area, which parses cleanly — 2009-01 onward, per area. GVR uses a wide matrix
with area names set vertically, which pdftotext shreds ("Burnab" / "y" on
separate lines); mapping a column back to an area by position would be
guesswork, so only the board total is taken, and only when it reconciles
against the sum of the columns before it.
